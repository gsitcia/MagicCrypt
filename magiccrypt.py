# 	THIS ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THEIR DATA SO SECURE THAT GOD CAN'T DECRYPT IT. THERE IS NO FORESEEABLE NEED TO HAVE DATA
# 	THIS SECURE, AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT 1,000 YEARS. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, THIS ENCRYPTION IS ENTIRELY SECURE, EVEN WITH A 5 BYTE RANDOMLY
# 	GENERATED KEY. THIS ENCRYPTION IS DESIGNED TO BE SECURE NOT ONLY NOW, BUT FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY, AND ANY CHANCE OF DECRYPTIING A MESSAGE
# 	USING THIS ALGORITHM WITHOUT THE KEY IS PURELY THEORETICAL. IF SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE, IT WON'T BE BY GUESSING THE KEY. IT'S MORE
# 	LIKELY THAT THEY'LL EXTRACT THE MESSAGE FROM YOUR BRAIN ONCE THEY KILL YOU, OR THEY'LL HACK THE MATRIX TO READ YOUR MIND.
#
# --------
#
# 	Note that the --human mode is nothing more than an ordinary magic number cipher. Actually, this entire encryption algorithm is just an overcomplicated, overglorified magic number cipher with a bunch of statistics and probabilities in the comments, along with about 200 guarantees that nobody will ever read your message and some cool features.
#
# //// -----------------------------------------
# 
# SOME BASIC INFO:
#
# The term 'key' refers to what a user inputs at the program prompt. The key tells the program how much to shift each letter in a message.
# --human mode refers to the mode the program is put in while passing the --human command-line argument.
#
# This code runs extremely slowly, and for a reason. Slower code allows less keys to be guessed in a gven amount of time. If this is to be used for a large network, run this code on the client-side, not server-side. This can and probably will put stress on your servers if you have many people running the encryption/decryption operations at once. Also, feel free to port this over to other programming languages for better performance, but if you don't use the same random number generators, you won't be able to encrypt/decrypt messages.
#
# When porting this over to other programming languages, make sure that random numbers generated are pseudo-random, not truly random, except where os.urandom(...) is used. This program relies on getting the same numbers for the same seed, and it isn't necessary for random numbers to be cryptographically secure; they just need to be unique to the seed, except when generating keys with the --genkey= argument
#
# When using fake (-f) mode, it's a good idea to make your key at least 2 or 3 bytes longer than your message.
# If the security of the data you have encrypted is important enough, keep the key on a destructable media, such as a USB flash drive or an SD card, so you can completely destroy the key if necessary. If you do that, though, it's a good idea to keep a backup copy of the key so the data itself isn't entirely lost, but don't let the backup fall into the wrong hands, either! Keep the backup on a self-destructable media, too, and create a new backup version once you destroy the first key; if you have to destroy the backup, you want a second backup. Continue the process of destroying and re-backing-up until either (a) the data is safe or (b) you can destroy the data forever.
#
#
#
# I have provided some example messages, encrypted using the -f argument, using the following encoded key: <-- The messages provided are NOT decryptable, since the random number generation has been changed since this was added to the comments
# 
# 	2w+1NMy4kr5j2r83EpRyVtFGtnQ8LmDk <-- This key DOES NOT work, since the random number generation has been changed since this was added to the comments
# 
# To decrypt the messages, use the folllowing command:
# 
# 	./magiccrypt.py --key='("raw", "2w+1NMy4kr5j2r83EpRyVtFGtnQ8LmDk")' -od
# 
# And change "-od" to "-oe" to encrypt using the same key.
# The --key= argument assumes -f, but without --key= you need to use:
# 
# 	./magiccrypt.py -f
# 
# Otherwise, you'll end up using the key unencoded, which is a completely different key.
# Every message here is encrypted and encoded with the default charset, in which the message will only be 1 line once encoded.
# 
# Some example messages are: <-- These message are NOT decryptable, since the random number generation has been changed since this was added to the comments

# ^^^ "Hello world" ^^^
# 
# An encoded key and a regular key are different. An encoded key represents a key; it isn't the key in itself. A regular key is the key itself. A key will be encoded so it can be put into the input prompt when it asks for the key. For example, try typing this:
# 
# 	DïSNuUžÄ6ånûÕ
#
# On my computer, when I pasted the above text, it thought I hit CTRL-C, since the key contains the ASCII character for CTRL-C.
# The text above is the actual key used for encrypting the example messages above, but I encoded it so that it could be used for encrypting and decrypting messages.
# Note that encoding a key or message does not encrypt it. All it does is put it into a charset that can be typed, copied and pasted.
# 
# //// -----------------------------------------


# NOTE: In --human mode, keys longer than the message they represent will be truncated to the length of the message, so for the message ABCDE, the keys QWERT, QWERTKJUSK, and QWERTIIAICLLAL are treated as the same. This ONLY works in --human mode

# ANOTHER NOTE: Longer keys will usually, if not always, be more secure, even in fake (-f) mode. It's probably best to use the longest key possible, since it's harder to guess, and in fake (-f) mode, it's more likely to look like the wrong one.

# YET ANOTHER NOTE: In --human mode, it's best to choose a key of the exact length of your message, or longer. There's no difference between using a 1-character key and using a Caesar Shift Cipher, which by the way, is easily broken on your average graphing calculator or even on paper.

# WHATEVER COMES AFTER "YET ANOTHER NOTE": Using fake (-f) mode with a non-randomly generated key is like using a supercar at 20mph without showing off how cool it is; the supercar doesn't get you there faster, just as a non-random key with fake (-f) mode doesn't hide your data any better. Seriously, if you're going to drive a supercar at 20mph, at least make people jealous of it!

# A FIFTH NOTE: Chances are that more than 1 key will decrypt your message, but don't worry. Nomatter how bad your practices are when choosing keys, nobody will be able to tell that it also works, unless they already know the message, in which case, they wouldn't even need a key in the first place. Just know that this doesn't protect you from them finding your actual key, just from them finding other keys that also work. The following Python code will tell you the probability that any individual key guessed will decrypt your message:
#
# 	print("1/%s" %((256**len(your_message))*(256**16))) # This works when you're not using --human mode
#
# Note that this does not take into account keys that resolve to an incorrect scope but still decrypt the message. There's more info about those cases below.
# And the probability that any individual key that resolves to the correct scope will decrypt your message is:
#
# 	print("1/%s" %(256**len(your_message))) # This works when you're not using --human mode
#
# So you can assume from the above code that the probability that any key guessed will resolve to the correct scope can be calculated by:
#
# 	print("1/%s" %(256**16))
#
# ^^^ This code should work for both Python2.7 and Python3.4 ^^^

# A SIXTH NOTE: If you use the same key for multiple messages, a brute-force attempt may not be entirely impossible; if someone can guess every possible key for 2 or more messages using the same key, they can notice that the same key decrypts both messages to what looks like it might be the original message. For that reason, it's best to switch keys with every message. A good way to do this if you can't securely get another key to the recipient is to encode the second key in the first message. Even still, this could reveal the key, but you'd need to send many thousands of messages in order to provide any significant vulnerability. Using a longer key will further reduce this risk, but if even a single key is insecure enough to be cracked, it could reveal every message in the chain.

# A SEVENTH NOTE: Still, don't worry! As of when this program was made (early 2016), there is no computer in the world known to be able to guess the key to a message, even if you don't use fake (-f) mode.

# AN EIGHTH NOTE: There is a very, very, very small chance that a key could look human-made, and generate a message that looks human-made saying something you really don't want being said and wasn't the intended message. There is an even smaller chance that a key that looks human-made, but still isn't your actual key, generates your actual message. If you happen to be so unlucky, you'll probably have a really tough time convincing people that that's not the message you sent. Of course, if someone guesses enough keys, they will eventually find one that looks human-made and generates a message that makes you look evil. They just have to be trying hard enough.

# A NINTH NOTE: With the default Python RNG (random number generator), there are actually only 27814431486576 possible unique states, which isn't enough to hide anything longer than a 5-character message. For that reason, I have redesigned it to offer unlimited unique states, based on the given seed.

# A TENTH NOTE: The custom random number generator used by this program is cryptographically secure and will generate an unlimited amount of unique sequences, based on the seed given. Each seed will generate a 100% unique sequence of pseudo-random numbers ranging in values from 1 to infinity, depending on the seed (and your CPU/RAM). The larger the seed, the larger and more random-esque the numbers generated will be. Feel free to use my random number generator, which is an adaptation to the Wichmann-Hill pseudo-random number generating algorithm.
